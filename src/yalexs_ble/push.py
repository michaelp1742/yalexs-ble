        outcome applied and the status poll booked, once and in one place. A
        cancel reaches it too, which is what keeps the window from leaking open
        with no operation in flight: the displayed status would otherwise
        freeze on the transitional, since the filter drops everything the lock
        sends while the window is open.

        _operation_outcome is what the exit knew, and None means it knew
        nothing about where the mechanism is. A jam recorded while the window
        was open outranks it either way: an outcome is a target state inferred
        from the command, while the jam is a reading of where the mechanism
        actually stopped. This is also the only chance to apply that jam,
        because the post-jam register fabricates a plain position, so the
        status poll booked below would put that on display instead, and no later
        signal marks the jam.

        Order matters. The window closes first, so the outcome passes the
        filter rather than being dropped by it, and an applied JAMMED
        discharges the record on its way through.

        When the display is left holding a position, the status poll is booked at
        the keep-alive interval, the cadence an always-connected lock polls at
        anyway. When it is left holding anything else, a transitional a cancel
        could not resolve or the unknown of a result that never came, only a
        read can settle it and it is booked at the settle debounce instead.
        That is the earliest such a read is worth taking, because a command
        already at the lock is still driving the motor and a read taken
        immediately returns the pre-operation position. The delay follows from
        the displayed status rather than from the exit taken, so an exit added
        later inherits the answer instead of choosing one.

        What keeps that read out of the settle window is the floor stamped
        here, not the delay asked for below. A booking names the latest moment
        a cycle may run and the deferred-update machinery shortens it freely:
        a pending booking due inside the coalescing interval rewrites this
        request to that interval, and a pending booking due sooner keeps its
        own time. The floor is held by every path that arms a cycle and
        re-applied when one falls due, so the read waits for the mechanism
        however short the booking became.
