        Error policy by stage (the caller's retry decorator sees the types).
        The acknowledgement carries no mechanical delay, so its absence
        signals a delivery problem and predicts a missing op-response: write
        and acknowledgement failures keep their retryable types (TimeoutError
        / DisconnectedError / BleakError) and the retry re-sends the command
        early rather than waiting out the op-response budget. Once the
        operation is acknowledged, a timeout or disconnect raises the
        non-retryable OperationIncompleteError, ending the attempt ladder: the
        result is unknown and the caller decides.

        response_timeout is the budget for the whole exchange, measured from
        the moment the command is issued. What is left for the op-response is
        that budget minus the time already spent, so it must leave room beyond
        the acknowledgement the operation waits for.
        OPERATION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT is that budget for a lock or an unlock, and
        an operation with a longer motion passes its own.

        wait_for_ack=False drops the acknowledgement stage and waits only for
        the op-response, for the whole budget. The early delivery signal is
        worth having only where the caller may re-send, so an operation that
        forbids a re-send once the command is written gains nothing from it
        and would pay for it with the op-response: an acknowledgement lost on
        a link that is otherwise working would end the operation before the
        result it is waiting for could arrive. The acknowledgement is still
        matched and recorded when it lands; only the wait on it is dropped.
